|---|:---|:---|:---|
|   3    |  [link to first OpenStreetMap contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81082711)   |  OpenStreet Map feature   |   I got rid of the pizza point icon for Pastafina, a pizzaria place that used to be located on 876 Lexington Ave. I removed the point icon because the business is no longer in service as it was closed down a few months ago.   |
|  3   |  [link to second OpenStreetMap contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81083091)   |  OpenStreet Map feature   |   I added a new supermarket point icon, marked the location with it's appropiate name: "Fine Fare Supermarket", and finally listed the correct address for the supermarket.   |

Originally, the sentence was slightly unclear; however, I modified it to sound smoother and clear up any ambiguity that may have been there before.|
| 5 | [link to fourth OpenStreetMap contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=19/40.71621/-73.98700)|OpenStreet Map feature|In the Lower East Side, I noticed that a new target location that was recently built at the address 400 Grand St wasn't marked within the OpenStreetMap system so I added a Target marker as well as all of the hours in which the store is open weekly.|
| 6|[link to blog edit change that I made to Denice's weekly blog](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/deniceysv-weekly/pull/2)| Blog Edit | I lowercased all instances of the words "Open Source" that weren't at the start of a sentence in Denice's week 2 and 5 blogs.|
| 7 |[link to fifth OpenStreetMap contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=id&changeset=82226214#map=19/40.71234/-74.01526) | OpenStreetMap feature |A new and rather small ice skating rink that opened a few years ago within the Brookfield Mall wasn't yet marked in the OpenStreetMap system so I decided to add both a new ice skating point icon for it as well as its exact address.|
|8|[link to some changes I made to one of lilulanz's weekly blogs](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/liulanz-weekly/pull/9)| Blog Edit |Fixed some minor grammar issues within the three paragraphs of lilulanz's week 4 blog to help improve and smoothen the writing flow of the blog.|
|8|[link to some changes I made to one of megamega53's weekly blogs](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/Megamega53-weekly/pull/9)| Blog Edit| Fixed a few sentences in megamega's week two blog that didn't quite flow so smoothly by changing some words and fixing some grammar issues. I also removed a sentence because it wasn't contributing much to the overall piece.|
|8|[link to some blog edit changes I made to one of cchloet's weekly blogs](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/cchloet-weekly/pull/9)|Blog Edit|Fixed some grammar issues and rewrote a few sentences to improve the writing within the week 4 blog. Also, fixed some markdown spacing issues. |
|8|[link to first wikipedia contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dow_Jones_%26_Company&diff=prev&oldid=946361720)|Wikipedia edit|Added a few sentences in the history section of the Dow Jones & Company Wikipedia page providing some extra historical information about Charles Dow, one of the founders of the Dow Jones & Company, and how his ability to convery rather difficult financial information to people helped shaped one of the company's primary missions which is to deliver world class news and financial information to people all across the globe.|
|9|[link to second wikipedia contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker&diff=prev&oldid=947383263)|Wikipedia edit|Added two additional important story details that weren't already mentioned within the plot section of the The Rise of Skywalker film wikipedia page. These details concern both Rey's yellow lightsaber at the end of the film, and the "secret" that Finn attempted to tell Rey throughout the whole entire film, but never got to. |
|10|[link to third wikipedia contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Dark_Knight_Rises&diff=prev&oldid=948437472)|Wikipedia edit| Added a few significant plot details in the plot section of the The Dark Knight Rises Wikipedia page. The first detail entails the fact that Bruce Wayne has retired from the Batman role for the past eight years and as a result has been a recluse. This is very important to include because one reason why Bruce has isolated himself is because the image of Batman has been ruined for Gotham's protection and as a result Bruce can no longer be his true self aka Batman, and is forced to play the part with his "Bruce Wayne" identity. The second plot detail gives important information regarding probably the most important scene in the entire movie which was not included already in the plot section aka the prison escape. The prison was virtually impossible to escape and in order to get out, Bruce had to train nonstop, overcome his fears, and learn how to be Batman again. He rises from the pit as a new revitalized Batman, thus symbolizing the title of the film, The Dark Knight Rises.
|10|[link to fourth wikipedia contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shark_Tank&diff=prev&oldid=948446120)|Wikipedia edit|Edited two lines within the Shark Tank Wikipedia page describing what the show is about, what the sharks critique about entrepreneurs, and who is usually the nicest shark on the show.|
|10|[link to fifth wikipedia contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier&diff=prev&oldid=949874108)|Wikipedia  edit|Added two sentences in the plot section of the Captain America: The Winter Soldier Wikipedia page mentioning what many consider to be the most iconic scene from the movie where Steve Rodgers finds himself battling his way out of S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters after S.H.I.E.L.D. agents intercept and try to capture him in an elevator. Added these two sentences since the scene wasn't already mentioned in the plot section and also because when most people think and talk about this movie they always think and mention this famous scene.|
|10 |[Gatsby Documentation Contribution](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/23106)|Project Documentation|Added a comment in the code example in one of the Gatsby doc pages stating that the url and nameWithOwner node fields are arbitrary fields from the data. Also added a note on the same doc page stating that node fields can be arbitrary and that they do not in anyway need to follow some sort of systematic guideline.|
